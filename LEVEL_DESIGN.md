# Level Design Breakdown 🎯

## New Improved Level Progression

### Level 1: Knight First Steps (4x4)
```
🚪 . . .    ← Exit at (3,0)
. 🟢 . .    ← Single slime obstacle at (1,1)
. . . .
♘ . . .    ← Knight starts at (0,3)
```
**Learning Goal**: Basic Knight L-movement around a simple obstacle
**Strategy**: Must use L-shaped moves to navigate around the slime

---

### Level 2: Pawn Power (4x4)  
```
. 🚪 . .    ← Exit at (2,0)
. . . .
. 🟢 . .    ← Slime blocks forward path at (2,2)  
. ♙ . .    ← Pawn starts at (1,3)
```
**Learning Goal**: Pawn diagonal capture mechanics
**Strategy**: Must capture the slime diagonally, then move forward to exit

---

### Level 3: Knight vs Slimes (5x5)
```
. . . . 🚪   ← Exit at (4,0)
. 🟢 . . .   ← Slime at (1,1)
. . . . .
. . 🟢 . .   ← Slime at (2,3)
♘ . . . .   ← Knight starts at (0,4)
```
**Learning Goal**: Knight tactics - capture vs. avoidance
**Strategy**: Can either capture slimes or navigate around them using L-moves

---

### Level 4: Pawn's Journey (5x5)
```
. . . . 🚪   ← Exit at (4,0)
. . . 🟢 .   ← Slime at (3,1) - forces diagonal thinking
. . . . .
. 🟢 . . .   ← Slime at (1,3) - can be captured diagonally
♙ . . . .   ← Pawn starts at (0,4)
```
**Learning Goal**: Complex pawn pathfinding with strategic captures
**Strategy**: Must plan ahead - when to capture vs. when to move forward

---

### Level 5: Chess Master Challenge (6x6)
```
. . . . . 🚪  ← Exit at (5,0)
🟢 . . . . .  ← Slime at (1,0) - guards near exit
. . 🟢 . 🟢 .  ← Slimes at (2,2) and (4,2)
. . . . . .
. 🟢 . 🟢 . .  ← Slimes at (1,4) and (3,4)  
♘ . . . . .  ← Knight starts at (0,5)
```
**Learning Goal**: Advanced Knight navigation in complex maze
**Strategy**: Multiple possible paths, requires planning several moves ahead

## Design Principles Applied ✅

1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level introduces one new concept
2. **Clear Learning Goals**: Every level teaches a specific chess skill
3. **Strategic Choices**: Multiple solutions encourage creative thinking
4. **Balanced Challenge**: Difficult enough to be engaging, easy enough to solve
5. **Chess-Focused**: All obstacles relate directly to piece movement rules

## Educational Value 📚

- **Level 1-2**: Basic piece movement (Knight L-shape, Pawn forward/diagonal)
- **Level 3-4**: Tactical decisions (capture vs. avoidance, path planning) 
- **Level 5**: Strategic thinking (multi-move planning, pattern recognition)

Each level can be completed in 3-6 moves, perfect for maintaining engagement while teaching chess fundamentals!
